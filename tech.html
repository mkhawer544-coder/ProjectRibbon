            <h1>Technology & Early Detection</h1>
            <p>Modern technology has revolutionized breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Early detection dramatically
                improves survival rates and treatment outcomes.</p>

                <h3>Mammography</h3>
                <p>Digital mammography uses low-dose X-rays to create detailed images of breast tissue. 3D mammography
                    (tomosynthesis) takes multiple images from different angles, allowing for better detection,
                    especially in dense breast tissue.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-card">
                <h3>Ultrasound</h3>
                <p>Breast ultrasound uses sound waves to create images and is particularly useful for examining lumps or
                    abnormalities found during mammograms. It's safe and doesn't use radiation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-card">
                <h3>MRI Technology</h3>
                <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides detailed images using magnetic fields and radio waves. It's often
                    used for high-risk patients or to determine the extent of cancer after diagnosis.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tech-highlight">
            <h3>AI & Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence is enhancing detection accuracy by analyzing mammogram images to identify subtle
                patterns that might indicate cancer. AI-powered systems can assist radiologists in detecting
                abnormalities earlier and with greater precision, reducing false positives and false negatives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tech-highlight">
            <h3>Genetic Testing</h3>
            <p>Advanced genetic testing can identify mutations in genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2 that increase breast cancer
                risk. This information helps individuals and their doctors make informed decisions about screening
                schedules and preventive measures.</p>

            <h2>Screening Guidelines</h2>

                <strong>Ages 40-44</strong>
                <p>Option to begin annual screening</p>

            <div class="strategy-item">
                <strong>Ages 45-54</strong>

            <div class="strategy-item">
                <strong>Ages 55+</strong>
                <p>Mammograms every 1-2 years, or annual if preferred</p>
            </div>
            <div class="strategy-item">
                <strong>High Risk</strong>
                <p>Earlier and more frequent screening, possibly including MRI</p>

        <div class="tech-highlight">
            <h2>Self-Examination</h2>
            <p>While technology is crucial, regular self-examination remains an important part of breast health. Know
                what's normal for you and report any changes to your doctor, including: lumps or thickening, changes in
                size or shape, skin dimpling or puckering, nipple discharge or inversion, redness or scaling of breast
                skin, or persistent pain in one area.</p>
