                <h2>Sarah's Journey to Recovery</h2>
                <p class="meta">Diagnosed at 25 • Cancer-free for 3 years</p>

                <p>I'll never forget that day in October 2021. I was sitting in the doctor's office, waiting for what I
                    thought would be a routine follow-up after my annual mammogram. But when the doctor walked in with
                    that look on her face, I knew something was wrong.</p>

                <p>"We found something," she said gently. Those three words changed my life forever.</p>

                <div class="quote">"The diagnosis was terrifying, but it also became a turning point—a moment where I
                    decided to fight with everything I had."</div>

                <p>The next few weeks were a blur of appointments, tests, and consultations. Stage 2 breast cancer. The
                    words felt surreal. I was 25, healthy, active, with dreams and plans for my future. How could this
                    be happening to me?</p>

                <p>But as the initial shock wore off, something else emerged: determination. I wasn't going to let this
                    disease define me or take away my future. I assembled my team—an incredible oncologist, a
                    compassionate surgeon, and most importantly, a support network of family, friends, and fellow
                    survivors who became my lifeline.</p>

                <p>Today, three years cancer-free, I look back on that journey with a mix of emotions. The fear and pain
                    were real, but so was the love, support, and personal growth that came from it.</p>

                <h2>Maria's Story of Resilience</h2>
                <p class="meta">Two-time survivor • 8 years in remission</p>

                <p>They say lightning doesn't strike twice, but breast cancer didn't get that memo. I've faced this
                    disease not once, but twice, and I'm still here to tell my story.</p>

                <p>My first diagnosis came at 38. I was a single mother working two jobs to support my three children.
                    When I found the lump during a self-exam, I almost ignored it—I didn't have time to be sick, and I
                    certainly couldn't afford to miss work. But something told me not to wait.</p>

                <div class="quote">"The first battle taught me that I was a fighter. The second battle proved it."</div>

                <p>Today, eight years after my second diagnosis, I'm thriving. I volunteer as a peer counselor, meeting
                    with newly diagnosed patients in the hospital. When I see that fear in their eyes—the same fear I
                    felt—I share my story.</p>

                <h2>Jennifer's Experience: Finding Strength</h2>
                <p class="meta">Diagnosed at 35 • Survivor for 5 years</p>

                <p>At 35, with two young children aged 3 and 5, cancer was the furthest thing from my mind. I was
                    juggling parenthood, a demanding career, and all the chaos that comes with raising small humans.</p>

                <p>The diagnosis shattered me. Not for myself, but for my babies. How do you explain cancer to a
                    three-year-old? How do you stay strong when you're terrified you might not see your children grow
                    up?</p>

                <div class="quote">"My children became my reason to fight—and my reason to find joy even in the darkest
                    moments."</div>

                <p>Five years later, I'm cancer-free and watching my children thrive. They're 8 and 10 now, full of life
                    and dreams. Cancer tried to steal my future with my children. Instead, it taught me to cherish every
                    single moment with them.</p>
