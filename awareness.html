        <h1>Mental Health & Emotional Wellness</h1>
        <p>A breast cancer diagnosis affects more than just physical health—it brings profound emotional and
            psychological challenges. Understanding and addressing these aspects is crucial for complete healing and
            well-being.</p>

                <h3>Emotional Impact</h3>
                <p>Patients often experience fear, anxiety, anger, and sadness. These emotions are normal and valid. The
                    uncertainty about treatment outcomes, changes to body image, and concerns about mortality can be
                    overwhelming.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="impact-card">
                <h3>Common Challenges</h3>
                <p>Depression and anxiety are common among breast cancer patients. Sleep disturbances, difficulty
                    concentrating, loss of appetite, and feelings of isolation can significantly impact quality of life
                    during and after treatment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="impact-card">
                <h3>For Survivors</h3>
                <p>Survivors may face fear of recurrence, survivor's guilt, difficulty returning to normal life, and
                    ongoing body image concerns. The transition from active treatment to survivorship brings its own
                    psychological challenges.</p>

            <h2>Supporting Loved Ones</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #475569; line-height: 1.8;">If someone you care about is facing breast
                cancer, your support matters immensely. Listen without trying to fix everything, offer specific help
                rather than "let me know if you need anything," respect their need for privacy or space when requested,
                and educate yourself about their diagnosis and treatment. Remember to also take care of your own mental
                health—supporting someone through cancer is emotionally demanding.</p>
